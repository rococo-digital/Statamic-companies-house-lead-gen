# Companies House Lead Generation - Multi-Rule System

A flexible, multi-stage lead generation system for Statamic that searches Companies House for target companies, finds contacts using Apollo, and adds them to Instantly lead lists.

## üöÄ New Features (v2.0)

### Multi-Rule System
- **Flexible Rules**: Define multiple lead generation rules with different search criteria
- **Individual Scheduling**: Each rule can have its own schedule (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Separate Lead Lists**: Each rule can target different Instantly lead lists
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed API usage and performance stats per rule
- **Force Run**: Override schedules and run rules manually

### Pre-Configured Rules
The system comes with two example rules:

1. **6 Month Old Companies** - Finds companies that are 6 months old
2. **Missing Confirmation Statements** - Finds companies 350+ days old missing confirmation statements

## üìã Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Configure API keys in `.env`:
```bash
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_key_here
APOLLO_API_KEY=your_key_here
INSTANTLY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Rule Configuration
Edit `config/ch-lead-gen.php` to customize rules:

```php
'rules' => [
    'custom_rule_key' => [
        'name' => 'My Custom Rule',
        'description' => 'Description of what this rule does',
        'enabled' => true,
        'search_parameters' => [
            'months_ago' => 6,                    // Company age in months
            'company_status' => 'active',         // active, dissolved, etc.
            'company_type' => 'ltd',              // ltd, plc, etc.
            'allowed_countries' => ['GB', 'US'],  // Country filter
            'max_results' => 200,                 // Max companies to process
            'check_confirmation_statement' => false, // Filter by missing statements
        ],
        'schedule' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'frequency' => 'weekly',              // daily, weekly, monthly
            'time' => '09:00',                    // 24-hour format
            'day_of_week' => 1,                   // 1=Monday (for weekly)
            'day_of_month' => 1,                  // 1-31 (for monthly)
        ],
        'instantly' => [
            'lead_list_name' => 'My Lead List',
            'enable_enrichment' => false,         // Apollo handles enrichment
        ],
    ],
],
```

## üìä Statistics & Monitoring

### Tracked Metrics
- **Execution Statistics**: Total runs, success rate, execution time
- **Company Metrics**: Companies found, contacts discovered, contacts added
- **API Usage**: Requests per service (Companies House, Apollo, Instantly)
- **Performance History**: Recent executions with detailed results

### API Usage Tracking
The system tracks API usage per rule and service:
- **Companies House**: Search, filing history, company profile requests
- **Apollo**: People search, bulk enrichment requests
- **Instantly**: Contact additions, lead list operations

## üîÑ Scheduling

### Cron Setup
Add to your crontab to enable automatic scheduling:
```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Schedule Types
- **Daily**: Runs every day at specified time
- **Weekly**: Runs on specific day of week at specified time
- **Monthly**: Runs on specific day of month at specified time
- **Manual**: No automatic scheduling, manual execution only

## üõ† Migration from Legacy System

If you're upgrading from the previous version:

1. **Backup**: Your existing configuration is preserved as "legacy" settings
2. **Rules**: Add rule configuration to your config file
3. **Testing**: Use `ch-lead-gen:rules test` to verify rules work correctly
4. **Gradual Migration**: Rules and legacy system can coexist

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Rules Configured
If no rules are configured, the system falls back to legacy behavior using your existing search parameters.

### Rule Not Running
- Check if rule is enabled: `ch-lead-gen:rules show <rule_key>`
- Verify schedule configuration
- Use force run to test: `ch-lead-gen:rules test <rule_key>`

### API Rate Limits
- Monitor API usage in dashboard
- Adjust rule schedules to spread load
- Check service-specific rate limits

### Statistics Not Showing
- Ensure statistics are enabled in config: `'stats' => ['enabled' => true]`
- Cache-based statistics may take time to populate
- Check log files for any errors

## üìù Example Rule Configurations

### High-Volume Daily Rule
```php
'daily_new_companies' => [
    'name' => 'Daily New Companies',
    'enabled' => true,
    'search_parameters' => [
        'months_ago' => 1,
        'max_results' => 1000,
        'check_confirmation_statement' => false,
    ],
    'schedule' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'frequency' => 'daily',
        'time' => '08:00',
    ],
    'instantly' => [
        'lead_list_name' => 'Daily New Companies',
    ],
],
```

### Weekly Compliance Check
```php
'weekly_compliance_check' => [
    'name' => 'Weekly Compliance Check',
    'enabled' => true,
    'search_parameters' => [
        'months_ago' => 12,
        'max_results' => 500,
        'check_confirmation_statement' => true,
    ],
    'schedule' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'frequency' => 'weekly',
        'time' => '09:00',
        'day_of_week' => 1, // Monday
    ],
    'instantly' => [
        'lead_list_name' => 'Compliance Issues',
    ],
],
```

## üîç API Reference

### Rule Manager Service

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two rules, monitor performance
2. **Stagger Schedules**: Avoid running multiple rules simultaneously
3. **Monitor API Usage**: Keep track of rate limits across all services
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use `ch-lead-gen:rules test` before enabling rules
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Check dashboard statistics regularly
6. **Backup Configuration**: Keep your rule configurations in version control

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the dashboard activity logs
2. Use `ch-lead-gen:rules list` to verify configuration
